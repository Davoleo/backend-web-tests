# Basic Commands

- `ls` - **Lists all the files and directories** inside of the focused directory
- `cd` - **Changes the focused directory** to a new one
(you can type multiple sub-dirs connecting them with the '/' char) 
(you navigate to the parent directory by doing `cd ..`)
- `touch` - **Creates a new file** with the passed name 
(Example: `touch turtle.txt` creates a "turtle.txt" file in the focused directory)
- `mkdir` - **Creates a new directory** as a subdirectory of the focused directory 
(Example: `mkdir animals` creates an "animals" folder in the focused directory)
- `rm` - **Removes a specified file** 
(You can use the `rm -rf"` flag to do recursive removal {allows the user to remove entire dirs})
